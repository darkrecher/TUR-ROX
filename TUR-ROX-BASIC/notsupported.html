        <h1>atto can't run in this browser :(</h1>
        <p>Unfortunately, your browser doesn't support the features that are required to run atto. If you're on mobile, try using atto on a desktop computer. Otherwise, please use the latest version of Chrome or Firefox, which are known to work with atto.</p>
        <p>If you're using Safari, then it's doubtful that Apple will ever implement the required features due to their <a href="https://jamesl.me/article.html?article=2020-10-21-safariie.md">constant reluctance to modernise their browser</a>. If you work for Apple/are on the WebKit dev team, please <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=174931">implement lookbehind in regex</a> so we can make atto work for everyone!</p>
