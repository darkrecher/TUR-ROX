[Guide](/index.md) ðŸ¢’ **I can already code well**

If you can already code at an advanced level, then we're confident that you'll find atto a breeze! atto is similar to BASIC, but with modern features to make the language more relevant to today.

Much like BASIC, each program line in atto must begin with a line number, otherwise atto will instead immediately execute that command in the shell. For the sake of convenient editing, it is suggested that each line number in atto should be a multiple of 10 (`10`, `20`, `30`) etc. so that lines can be added in-between.

The `renum` command can be called in the shell to renumber the program in multiples of 10 if you run out of lines. Lines can also be deleted by entering the line number just by itself, for example, `20`. Typing `list` will display your current code, which is useful if you've ran it and you can no longer see your code.

Here is a basic demo of the infamous `Hello, world!` program:

```
10 print "Hello, world!"
20 goto 10
```

This example will continuously write `Hello, world!` to the screen until you press the Esc key to interrupt it. You can run this example with the `run` command.

Since atto is a full programming language, variables can also unsurprisingly be used:

```
10 untyped=10.5
20 number%=7
30 string$="Hello!"
40 print untyped; ", "; number%; ", "; string$
```

As you can see, variables may be suffixed with a sigil symbol to cast them to a particular type. The `$` sigil will convert a variable to a string, and the `%` sigil will convert a variable to a number. Variables are case-insensitive to aid editing for learners.

This example also features the string concatenation operator (`;`), which can additionally be used at the end of a `print` command to prevent the automatic printing of a newline character at the end of a string.

You've finished our introductory guide! Now's a great time to move onto our next guide, where you get to draw shapes and patterns to the screen using the turtle feature in atto. You'll also be learning how to perform iteration in atto.
