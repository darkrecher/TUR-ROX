<a name="ov"></a><h3>Overview</h3>

     ZZT provides a special
type of creature, the Object,
that can be made to interact
with the player and the environment by using a small
object-oriented command
language.  Objects are very
versatile, and can move, talk
and bargain with the player,
and communicate with other
Objects.<p>

To put an Object on the
playing field, type <tt>F2 O</tt>.
Next, you can choose a character to represent the Object. Finally, you can enter
a program to control it.<p>

     To change an Object's
program, move the cursor to
the Object and press Enter.<p>

<h3>How they work</h3>

     During game play, the
Objects are actively controlled by their associated
programs.<p>
Commands are
executed in tempo with the
game.  Usually, an Object is
updated 4 or 5 times per second, and several commands are
executed on each update.<p>

     Objects communicate with
each other and with the environment by sending and receiving messages.  Understanding ZZT-OOP is often difficult because it is possible
to have many objects operating at the same time, and
each object can interact with
any other object at any time.

<h3>Interaction</h3>

     A programmable creature
can put flashing one-line or two-line messages at the bottom of
the screen.  It can also put
multi-line scrolling messages
on the screen. These messages
can be interactive, so that
the player can pick choices
from a menu.<p>

     Objects can also move,
shoot, and interact with
other objects.<p>

<h3>Messages - What are they?</h3>

     ZZT's programming language is object-oriented,
meaning that a program's flow
of execution is controlled by
sending and receiving messages. Whenever an important
event occurs, a message is
sent to an object. This
causes the program to execute
specific instructions to
handle the event. Messages
can come from two sources:
from other programmable creatures and from the game itself.<p>

     For example, whenever the
player touches an object, that
object receives the message,
"<tt>TOUCH</tt>".  The object can then
act on the message, for example by greeting the player or
attacking.  Or, the object can
ignore the message.<p>

     Similarly, objects can
communicate with each other by
exchanging messages. For example, a board contains a
"BUTTON" object and a "GATE"
object.  The player touches
the button.  Upon being
touched, the button sends the
message "OPEN" to the gate
object.  The gate, upon receiving this message, moves
aside.<p>

     The first step to learning ZZT-OOP is seeing actual
programs with explainations, in the <a href="langtut.html">ZZT-OOP Tutorial</a>.
