<h1>ZZT-OOP Programming Language</h1>
<h2>Tutorial</h2>

   The best way to learn something is to jump right in, so
let's not waste any time.<p>

To put an object on the
board, press <tt>F2 O</tt>. After
picking a character to represent the object,  you can
enter a program to control it.<p>

<h3>Here is an example program</h3>
<pre>
 Commands    Comments
 ----------  -----------------
 @BadGuy     ' We are giving this object the name "BadGuy".
 /s/s/s      ' Start out by moving south three times.
 #shoot n    ' Next, shoot north.
 #end        ' Now stop and wait for us to receive a message.
 :shot       ' When we receive a "SHOT" message, start doing the following commands.
 #shoot seek ' Shoot towards the player.
 #end        ' Stop and wait for another message.
 :touch      ' Do the following when we receive a "TOUCH" message
 Ouch! Stop touching me.
             ' Put the preceeding text on the screen.
 #send shot  ' Next, send ourselves the message "SHOT".</pre><br>


   Note that the "SHOT" message will be sent to BadGuy
whenever the player shoots
BadGuy.  Likewise, when the
player touches BadGuy, BadGuy
will receive the "TOUCH" message.<p>

   ZZT-OOP is a relatively
simple language and its commands are straightforward.
   The primary difference between ZZT-OOP and conventional
languages such as BASIC is the
use of messages.<p>

   The following two objects
illustrate a more intense use
of messages:<p>

<h3>Here is the first object:</h3>
<pre>@Lefty          ' This object's name
/e/e/e/e        ' Move east 4 times
/w/w/w/w        ' Move west 4 times
#send Righty Do ' Send the "Do" message to the object named "Righty"
#end            ' and halt.</pre>

<h3>Here is the other object:</h3>
<pre>@Righty             ' This is our name
#end                ' Don't do anything until we receive a message
:do                 ' Here's the "Do" message
/w/w/w/w            ' Move west 4 times
/e/e/e/e            ' Move east 4 times
#send lefty:restart ' Tell your counterpart to restart
#end                ' Done for now</pre>

   These two objects form a
feedback loop.  When the game
starts, Lefty will move, then
send a message to Righty.
This causes Righty to move
then tell Lefty to restart.
So lefty moves, etc, etc, etc.<p>

   So concludes this mini-tutorial.  Once you think you
have a grasp of the idea of
ZZT-OOP programs and messages,
you are ready to proceed to...
